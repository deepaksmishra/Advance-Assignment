    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:It allows us to develop applications using an Object-Oriented approach. In Python,\n",
    "    we can easily create and use classes and objects. An object-oriented paradigm \n",
    "    is to design the program using classes and objects.\n",
    "    The object is related to real-word entities such as book, house, pencil, etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "Ans: All of these objects are namespaces (packages of variables), and the inheritance search is\n",
    "    simply a search of the tree from bottom to top looking for the lowest occurrence of an attribute name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "Ans: Class : a specification, blueprint for an object.\n",
    "Object : physical presence of the class in memory.\n",
    "Instance : an unique copy of the object (same structure, different data)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What makes the first argument in a classâ€™s method function special?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The reason you need to use self. is because Python does not use the @ syntax to \n",
    "refer to instance attributes. Python decided to do methods in a way that makes\n",
    "the instance to which the method belongs be passed automatically, but not received \n",
    "automatically: the first parameter of methods is the instance the method is called on.\n",
    "That makes methods entirely the same as functions, and leaves the actual name to use up to you \n",
    "(although self is the convention, and people will generally frown at you when you use something else.) \n",
    "self is not special to the code, it's just another object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is the purpose of the __init__ method?\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "    __init__ is a reseved method in python classes. It is called as a constructor in object oriented terminology. \n",
    "    This method is called when an object is created from \n",
    "    a class and it allows the class to initialize the attributes of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is the process for creating a class instance?\n",
    "Ans:When you create an object, you are creating an instance of a class, therefore \"instantiating\" a class.\n",
    "    The new operator requires a single, postfix argument: a call to a constructor. \n",
    "    The name of the constructor provides the name of the class to instantiate. The constructor initializes the new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the process for creating a class?\n",
    "Ans: Class variable is a variable that is shared by all the different objects/instances of a class.\n",
    "Instance variables are variables which are unique to each instance. It is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.\n",
    "Methods are also called as functions which are defined in a class and describes the behaviour of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "class Class_name:\n",
    "statement-1\n",
    "\n",
    "statement-N\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How would you define the superclasses of a class?\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "The class from which a class inherits is called the parent or superclass.\n",
    "A class which inherits from a superclass is called a subclass, also called heir class or child class. \n",
    "Superclasses are sometimes called ancestors as well. There exists a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "# superclass\n",
    "class Person():\n",
    "    def display1(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is superclass\")\n",
    " \n",
    "# subclass\n",
    "class Employee(Person):\n",
    "    def display2(self):\n",
    "        print(\"This is subclass\")\n",
    "emp = Employee()  # creating object of subclass\n",
    " \n",
    "emp.display1()\n",
    "emp.display2()"
