    "Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "Ans:Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages \n",
    "    in which an object or class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent object or parent class.\n",
    "    This can be addressed in various ways, including using virtual inheritance.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q2. What is the concept of delegation?\n",
    "Ans: Delegation is an object oriented technique (also called a design pattern). \n",

    "Q3. What is the concept of composition?\n",
    "Ans:Composition is a concept that models a has a relationship. \n",
    "    It enables creating complex types by combining objects of other types. \n",
    "    This means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component . \n",
    "    This relationship means that a Composite has a Component .\n",

    "Q4. What are bound methods and how do we use them?\n",
    "Ans: A bound method is the one which is dependent on the instance of the class as the first argument.\n",
    "    It passes the instance as the first argument which is used to access the variables and functions. \n",
    "    In Python 3 and newer versions of python, all functions in the class are by default bound methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?\n",
    "Ans: n Python, all instance attributes wind up in the single instance object at the bottom of the class tree. \n",
    "    This is different from the C++ model, where each class gets its own space for data members it defines\n"
