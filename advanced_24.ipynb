        "Ans: Imports are pretty straightforward really. Just remember the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "'import' and 'from xxx import yyy' are executable statements. They execute when the running program reaches that line.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "If a module does exist in sys.modules then an import simply returns that module whether or not it has completed executing. That is the reason why cyclic imports may return modules which appear to be partly empty.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the executing script runs in a module named __main__, importing the script under its own name will create a new module unrelated to __main__.\n",

        "Ans: Python __all__ is a list of public objects of that module, as interpreted by import *. The __all__ overrides the default of hiding everything that begins with an underscore. The __all__ in Python is a list of strings defining what symbols in a module will be exported when from <module> import * is used on the module."

If this file is being imported from another module, __name__ will be set to the module’s name. Module’s name is available as value to __name__ global variable. \n",

        "Ans: Reverse Polish notation (RPN), also known as Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands, in contrast to Polish notation (PN), in which operators precede their operands. It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. "
