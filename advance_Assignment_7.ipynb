    "Q1. What is the purpose of the try statement?\n",
    "Ans: The try block lets you test a block of code for errors.it has a suspecious code.\n",
    "\n",

    "Q2. What are the two most popular try statement variations?\n",

    "\n",
    "Q4. What does the assert statement do, and what other statement is it like?\n",
    "Ans: The assert keyword is used when debugging code. The assert keyword lets you test if a condition in your code returns True, if not, the program will raise an AssertionError. \n",
    "    You can write a message to be written if the code returns False, check the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is the purpose of the with/as argument, and what other statement is it like?\n",
    "Ans:with/as tement in Python is used in exception handling to make the code cleaner and much more readable. It simplifies the management of common resources like file streams.\n",
    "    Observe the following code example on how the use of with statement makes code cleaner.\n"
