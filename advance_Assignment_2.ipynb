    "Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "Ans:Basically, a class can be instantiated but a module cannot. \n",
    "    A module will never be anything other than a library of methods. \n",
    "    A class can be so much more -\n",
    "    it can hold its state (by keeping track of instance variables) and be duplicated as many times as you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How do you make instances and classes?\n",
    "Ans:To create instances of a class, call the class using class name and pass in whatever arguments \n",
    "its __init__ method accepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Where and how should be class attributes created?\n",
    "Ans: They will be shared by all the instances of the class. Therefore they have the same value for every instance.\n",
    "    We define class attributes outside all the methods, usually they are placed at the top, right below the class header.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Where and how are instance attributes created?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "    An instance attribute is a Python variable belonging to one, and only one, object. This variable is only accessible in the\n",
    "    scope of this object and it is defined inside the constructor function, __init__(self,..) of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What does the term \"self\" in a Python class mean?\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "self represents the instance of the class. \n",
    "By using the “self” keyword we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?\n",
    "Ans: Python operators work for built-in classes.\n",
    "    For example, the + operator will perform arithmetic addition on two numbers, merge two lists, or concatenate two strings.\n",
    "    This feature in Python that\n",
    "    allows the same operator to have different meaning according to the context is called operator overloading.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. When do you consider allowing operator overloading of your classes?\n",
    "Ans: when the two methods uses same resources for performing the operation foe example '+' operator is used to \n",
    "    concatination as well as addition has used two diffrent data types operation string and integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What is the most popular form of operator overloading?\n",
    "Ans: Overloading binary + operator in Python :​​ When we use + operator, \n",
    "        the magic method __add__ is automatically invoked in which the operation for + operator is defined. \n",
    "        There by changing this magic method's code, we can give extra meaning to the + operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What are the two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend Python OOP code?\n",
    "Ans: Class & object"
