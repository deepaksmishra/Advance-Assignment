    "Q1. What is the difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__?\n",
    "Ans:  key difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__ is that __getattr__ is only invoked if the attribute wasn't found the usual ways.\n",
    "    __getattribute__ is invoked before looking at the actual attributes on the object, \n",
    "    and so can be tricky to implement correctly. You can end up in infinite recursions very easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?\n",
    "Ans: descriptors are a low-level mechanism that lets you hook into an object's attributes being accessed. \n",
    "    Properties are a high-level application of this; that is, properties are implemented using descriptors\n",

    "\n",
    "Q3. What are the key differences in functionality between __getattr__ and __getattribute__, as well as properties and descriptors?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "getattribute: Is used to retrieve an attribute from an instance. It captures every attempt to access an instance attribute by using dot notation or getattr() built-in function.\n",
    "getattr: Is executed as the last resource when attribute is not found in an object. You can choose to return a default value or to raise AttributeError."
